	 <h1>Mitigating Climate Change: A Hands-On Analysis</h1>

	 <p class="contextp">As I talked about in my last blog, we need to plant way too many trees (specifically ~1.607 trillion) in order to go carbon neutral. I decided to put a spin on two important pieces of data from it by making them interactive. Here, we have some adjustable values that when adjusted, give different results, so you can see what different plans of action we'd need to do in different scenarios. The first of these shows how many trees we'd need to plant based on different amounts of carbon that we emit annually. <br><br>The controls are simple: click and hold the blue underlined value in the middle column, then while still holding down your mouse, move it left or right to decrease and increase the value.</p>

	 <table class="analysesTable" id="treeAnalysis1">
	 	<tr class="analysis" id="an1">-
	 		<td>A tree absorbs 13 pounds of carbon annually (Source: <a href="https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2015/03/17/power-one-tree-very-air-we-breathe">usda.gov</a> and additional calculations done).</td>
	 		<td>So, to absorb <span class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-var="carbonintake" data-min="1" data-max="20" data-step="1"> billion US tons of carbon</span>...</td>
	 		<td>...we need to plant <b data-var="treeamount"> billion trees</b>.</td>
	 	</tr>
	 </table>

	 <p class="contextp">Trees, of course, require space to plant. We need quite a lot of land area in order to plant a lot of them. So, the next analysis would be one that shows how much area we need to plant trees based on how many trees we're planting and how much space we give each tree. <br><br>The controls are the same as before.</p>

	 <table class="analysesTable" id="treeAnalysis2">
	 	<tr class="analysis" id="an2">
	 		<td>Assume one tree needs <span class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-var="treespace" data-min="150" data-max="900" data-step="10">  square feet of space.</td>
	 		<td>So, in order to plant <br><span class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-var="treeamount" data-min="500" data-max="2000" data-step="75"> billion trees</span>...</td>
	 		<td>...we need <b data-var="treespaceamount"> million square kilometers of space.</td>
	 	</tr>
	 </table>

	 <p class="contextp">For reference, the land area of the United States is about 9 million square kilometers. If we used 25 million square kilometers of space to plant these trees, we'd need to dedicate an area more than the size of the entirety of the USA and Russia to planting trees! That would be more than the land area taken up by the entire Soviet Union in the 1970s!</p>

	 <p class="contextp">Now, recently a lot of new technology has been invented that provide man-made ways of carbon capture. So, these should be easier to get our hands on since we can make them ourselves. The question is, are these methods more efficient than trees? <br><br> The first of these methods are called liquid solvents, and are a class of molecule called amine. Amines are built from the chemical compound ammonia, whose formula is NH<sub>3</sub>. There are 4 main types of amines we will be discussing: monoethanolamine (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>7</sub>NO, aka MEA), methyl diethanolamine (C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>13</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>, aka MDEA), diethanolamine (C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>11</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>, aka DEA), and diglycolamine (same formula as DEA, aka DGA). The only difference between DGA and DEA is how the atoms in each molecule of them are arranged. Now, it takes one molecule of each of these amines to capture one molecule of carbon dioxide (whose formula is CO<sub>2</sub>). So, we can get the atomic weight of each molecule of these amines and compare it to the atomic weight of each molecule of carbon dioxide. <br><br> Here is the analysis we have for solvents based on this info:</p>

	 <table class="analysesTable" id="solventAnalysis1">
	 	<tr class="analysis" id="an5_1">
	 		<td>A molecule of carbon dioxide has a weight of around 44 atomic mass units.</td>
	 		<td>So, to absorb <span class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-var="carbonintake" data-min="1" data-max="20" data-step="1"> billion US tons of carbon</span> annually...</td>
	 	</tr>
	 	<tr class="analysis" id="an5_2">
	 		<td>...using MEA, which has a molecular weight of ~61 atomic mass units...</td>
	 		<td>...we'd need <b data-var="solventNeeded_mea"> billion US tons of MEA</b>.</td>
	 	</tr>
	 	<tr class="analysis" id="an5_3">
	 		<td>...using MDEA, which has a molecular weight of ~119 atomic mass units...</td>
	 		<td>...we'd need <b data-var="solventNeeded_mdea"> billion US tons of MDEA</b>.</td>
	 	</tr>
	 	<tr class="analysis" id="an5_4">
	 		<td>...using DEA or DGA, which have molecular weights of ~105 atomic mass units...</td>
	 		<td>...we'd need <b data-var="solventNeeded_dea_dga"> billion US tons of DEA or DGA</b>.</td>
	 	</tr>
	 </table>

	 <p class="contextp">"Carbon" is bolded and underlined in the previous analysis because it is different from "carbon dioxide," which I mentioned in the previous paragraph. Carbon is an element found in the molecule carbon dioxide. In a carbon dioxide molecule, carbon makes up around 27% of the mass of a carbon dioxide molecule. This is important because one molecule of each of these amines binds to one molecule of <b><u>carbon dioxide</u></b>, and the unit our slider measures our yearly emissions in is tons of <b><u>carbon</u></b>, so this alters the calculation a bit. <br><br> Also, take these numbers with a grain of salt. They only work in aqueous solutions, which means that they have to be mixed with water in order to work. Also, in those aqueous solutions, it's easily possible for carbon to miss the amine entirely while passing through a tank of amine. So, the amounts of various amines given here will not be as effective as they actually should be. <br><br>
	Now, with the numbers above being immensely high, and with the other footnotes I added to it, it may seem like the battle is lost. However, the janissaries have not arrived on the field yet. In this really weird analogy, the "janissaries" are Direct Air Capture facillites, which I'll refer to as DAC facilities. There are two major companies working on advancing DAC technology. These companies are Climeworks, which is based in Switzerland, and Carbon Engineering, which is based in Canada. Let's begin with Climeworks: <br><br>
	Climeworks was founded in 2009 by two college students who developed their first DAC technology two years earlier. Since 2017, they have built 15 plants across Europe, with their biggest one nicknamed "Orca" opening in Iceland on September 8th, 2021. Orca absorbs 4,000 metric tons of <b>carbon dioxide</b> (again, this is carbon dioxide, not carbon) annually. While this definitely brings us closer than we ever have been to solving the issue that is climate change, we still need a lot of these facilities to make a reasonable dent in the problem, which you will see in the analyses below. <br><br>
	Carbon Engineering was also founded in 2009, except in Calgary, Canada. It has since moved to Squamish, British Columbia, where it has built it's first DAC facility. Now, they have goals to begin constructing a facility in the Permian Basin in Texas this year, with help of the company 1PointFive, that will absorb 1 million US tons of carbon dioxide annually! Again, this will be a massive step towards solving the problem that is climate change, we will still need a lot of these facilities to make a dent in the problem, although less of these will be needed than facilities like Climeworks' Orca will be needed. <br><br> Based on the given info, here is the first analysis for Climeworks' Orca:</p>

	 <table class="analysesTable" id="climeworksAnalysis1">
	 	<tr class="analysis" id="an6">
	 		<td>Climeworks' Orca facility in Iceland absorbs 4,000 metric tons of <u><b>carbon dioxide</b></u>.</td>
	 		<td>So, to absorb <span class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-var="carbonintake" data-min="1" data-max="20" data-step="1"> billion US tons</span> of <u><b>carbon</b></u> annually...</td>
	 		<td>...we need to build <b data-var="climeDacsBuilt"> million Orcas</b>.</td>
	 	</tr>
	 	<tr>
	 </table>

	 <p class="contextp">Here is the same analysis for Carbon Engineering and 1PointFive's planned facility in Texas:</p>

	 <table class="analysesTable" id="ceAnalysis1">
	 	<tr class="analysis" id="an7">
	 		<td>Carbon Engineering's planned facility in Texas would absorb 1 million US tons of <u><b>carbon dioxide</b></u> annually.</td>
	 		<td>So, to absorb <span class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-var="carbonintake" data-min="1" data-max="20" data-step="1"> billion US tons</span> of <u><b>carbon</b></u> annually...</td>
	 		<td>...we need to build <b data-var="ceDacsBuilt"> thousand Carbon Engineering DAC facilites</b> like the one being built in Texas.</td>
	 	</tr>
	 </table>

	 <p class="contextp">Again, carbon and carbon dioxide are bolded to highlight the same thing I mentioned after the solvent analysis. Another thing to note is that the number for how much carbon dioxide Orca absorbs annually is in metric tons, whereas we've usually been using US tons and our final result from the calculation in the analysis is in US tons. By the way, we do use US tons like usual for Carbon Engineering's facility analysis. <br><br>Here is our last analysis (which, sadly, isn't interactive):<br><br>
	One thing I forgot to mention about Climeworks' Orca is that the facility stores captured carbon deep underground, where it reacts with basalt rock under the volcanic soil of Iceland and forms various types of minerals. However, this then brings up the question of whether we have enough space underground (or anywhere at all) to store all of this carbon. So, let's begin the calculations to figure this out: <br><br>
	The density of carbon in it's amorphous form is 1.9 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. "Amorphous" just means raw carbon which hasn't been given a definite shape, which is the state extracted carbon will be in after it's extracted from the air. Now, the volume of Lake Baikal is 5,666 cubic miles, or 23,617 cubic kilometers. We can then use conversion factors between units of volume and mass to get the volume of carbon in tons per cubic mile, a better unit for our current numbers that we have. This gets us roughly 8.7 gigatons per cubic mile. Doing some more calculations, we find that each year, we emit enough carbon to fill up roughly 1.14 cubic miles. This means that it would take nearly 5,000 years to fill up the entirety of Lake Baikal with our carbon emissions! <br><br>
	Now, this is absolutely not a call to action to begin filling up our lakes with carbon; that is extremely destructive to the environment, and there are definitely better places to put it. However, there are definitely places which we can fill up with our carbon emissions that are underground. For example, assuming we begin to slowly phase out the usage of fossil fuels and coal soon, we can fill up abandoned fracking wells and coal mines with the carbon, completing the Circle of Life (or carbon emissions, I guess) and sending the carbon right back to where it originated from. <br><br>
	So, technologies do exist that allow us to combat climate change more efficiently than we ever could. However, our annual emissions are still increasing. If we want to combat climate change, we need to begin mass producing this technology now.</p>
