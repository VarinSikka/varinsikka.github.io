	 <h1>Mitigating Climate Change: A Hands-On Analysis</h1>

	 <p class="contextp">updated 1: <br><br> As I talked about in my last blog, we need to plant way too many trees (specifically ~1.607 trillion) in order to go carbon neutral. I decided to put a spin on two important pieces of data from it by making them interactive. Here, we have some adjustable values that when adjusted, give different results, so you can see what different plans of action we'd need to do in different scenarios. The first of these shows how many trees we'd need to plant based on different amounts of carbon that we emit annually. <br><br>The controls are simple: click and hold the blue underlined value in the middle column, then while still holding down your mouse, move it left or right to decrease and increase the value.</p>

	 <table class="analysesTable" id="treeAnalysis1">
	 	<tr class="analysis" id="an1">-
	 		<td>A tree absorbs 13 pounds of carbon annually (Source: <a href="https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2015/03/17/power-one-tree-very-air-we-breathe">usda.gov</a> and additional calculations done).</td>
	 		<td>So, to absorb <span class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-var="carbonintake" data-min="1" data-max="20" data-step="1"> billion US tons of carbon</span>...</td>
	 		<td>...we need to plant <b data-var="treeamount"> billion trees</b>.</td>
	 	</tr>
	 </table>

	 <p class="contextp">Trees, of course, require space to plant. We need quite a lot of land area in order to plant a lot of them. So, the next analysis would be one that shows how much area we need to plant trees based on how many trees we're planting and how much space we give each tree. <br><br>The controls are the same as before.</p>

	 <table class="analysesTable" id="treeAnalysis2">
	 	<tr class="analysis" id="an2">
	 		<td>Assume one tree needs <span class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-var="treespace" data-min="150" data-max="900" data-step="10">  square feet of space.</td>
	 		<td>So, in order to plant <span class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-var="treeamount" data-min="500" data-max="2000" data-step="75"> billion trees</span>...</td>
	 		<td>...we need <b data-var="treespaceamount"> million square kilometers of space.</td>
	 	</tr>
	 </table>

	 <p class="contextp">For reference, the land area of the United States is about 9 million square kilometers. If we used 25 million square kilometers of space to plant these trees, we'd need to dedicate an area more than the size of the entirety of the USA and Russia to planting trees! That would be more than the land area taken up by the entire Soviet Union in the 1970s!</p>

	 <p class="contextp">Now, recently a lot of new technology has been invented that provide man-made ways of carbon capture. So, these should be easier to get our hands on since we can make them ourselves. The question is, are these methods more efficient than trees? <br><br>The first of these methods involves using liquid solvents and solid adsorbents (sort of like sponges, we'll call them "sorbents" for short). These two substances capture carbon and can release it with steam. Since I didn't talk about these in my previous blog, let's go over them a bit: <br><br>(talk about efficiency of sorbent source looked up in singapore) <br><br>Here is the analysis we have for sorbents based on this data:</p>

	 <table class="analysesTable" id="sorbentAnalysis1">
	 	<tr class="analysis" id="an4">
	 		<td>Some sorbent in a certain quantity (include dimensions and type of solid sorbent) absorbs x amount of carbon per year.</td>
	 		<td>So, to absorb (adj val here) gigatons of carbon annually...</td>
	 		<td>...we need to be using (adj'd val here) of these.</td>
	 	</tr>
	 </table>

	 <p class="contextp">Here is a similar analysis for amine liquid solvents, however there are 4 rows, one for each of the liquid solvent types we're studying:</p>

	 <table class="analysesTable" id="solventAnalysis1">
	 	<tr class="analysis" id="an5_1">
	 		<td>A molecule of carbon dioxide has a weight of around 44 atomic mass units.</td>
	 		<td>So, to absorb <span class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-var="carbonintake" data-min="1" data-max="20" data-step="1"> billion US tons of carbon</span> annually...</td>
	 	</tr>
	 	<tr class="analysis" id="an5_2">
	 		<td>...using MEA, which has a molecular weight of 33 atomic mass units...</td>
	 		<td>...we'd need <b data-var="solventNeeded_mea"> billion US tons of MEA</b>.</td>
	 	</tr>
	 	<tr class="analysis" id="an5_3">
	 		<td>...using MDEA, which has a molecular weight of 48 atomic mass units...</td>
	 		<td>...we'd need <b data-var="solventNeeded_mdea"> billion US tons of MDEA</b>.</td>
	 	</tr>
	 	<tr class="analysis" id="an5_4">
	 		<td>...using DEA or DGA, which have molecular weights of 49 atomic mass units...</td>
	 		<td>...we'd need <b data-var="solventNeeded_dea_dga"> billion US tons of DEA or DGA</b>.</td>
	 	</tr>
	 </table>

	 <p class="contextp">Take these numbers with a grain of salt. They only work in aqueous solutions, which means that they have to be mixed with water in order to work. Also, in those aqueous solutions, it's easily possible for carbon to miss the amine entirely while passing through a tank of amine. So, the amounts of various amines given here will not be as effective as they actually should be. Also, I didn't include Non-aqueous AMP because one molecule of it is already quite heavy (62 amu), but also you need two molecules of it to bind to one molecule of carbon dioxide and capture it. So, you will actually need just as much non-aqueous AMP as you would need another aqueous amine with water. <br><br> contextp here; will work on it later</p>

	 <table class="analysesTable" id="climeworksAnalysis1">
	 	<tr class="analysis" id="an6">

	 	</tr>
	 </table>

	 <p class="contextp">"Carbon dioxide" and "carbon" are bolded and underlined in the previous analysis because they are different. Carbon is an element found in the molecule carbon dioxide. In a carbon dioxide molecule, carbon makes up around 27% of the mass of a carbon dioxide molecule, so this alters the calculation done in the analysis quite a bit. Another thing to note is that the number for how much carbon dioxide Orca absorbs annually is in metric tons, whereas we've usually been using US tons and our final result from the calculation in the analysis is in US tons. By the way, we do use US tons like usual for Carbon Engineering's facility analysis. <br><br>contextp here; will work on it later <br><br>The range of the density value goes from 1.8 to 3.6 grams/cubic centimeter because the density of amorphous carbon is 1.9 g/cm<sup>3</sup> and the density of diamond (which is the densest allotrope of carbon) is 3.52 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p>

                        How do we remove excess carbon from the atmosphere?  This question is at the heart of the climate change crisis we face.  
			Currently at COP26 in Glasgow, world leaders are debating and discussing many different aspects of climate change, like 
			lowering GHG emissions from factories, landfills, cars, planes, our homes and offices, reducing our meat consumption, 
			going to plant based foods, from dealing with cows belching methane to removing plastic from the oceans, from lowering
			our oil addiction to producing better energy, and storing it and many others.  All of this is great, and if we can 
			mobilize action on these fronts, super.  But, if we want to make substantial progress, I think the main question to 
			address is: how do we remove excess carbon from our atmosphere?  In this series of blogs I want to address this question,
			from my point of view as a 14 year old.

			There is a lot of talk, and also some action, around using trees to remove carbon. Last year, in my final year of middle 
			school, I did some experiments to understand the size and scale of this, inspired by Fermi Estimates 
			(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_problem">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_problem</a>). 
			Here is what I found:
			</p>
			    
			
			<p>
			According to NASA (<a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/3020/how-much-carbon-dioxide-are-we-emitting/">Source</a>),  
		in 2014 we released ~35 billion metric tons (or roughly 38.5 Billion US tons, or Gigatons, which is what I will use here) 
		of Carbon Dioxide from fossil fuels into the atmosphere.  In 2019, before Covid, this number went up to about 43 billion tons
		(<a href="https://www.theworldcounts.com/challenges/climate-change/global-warming/global-co2-emissions/story">Source</a>).
		According to experts (<a href="https://www.quora.com/How-much-carbon-is-in-the-world-s-atmosphere-in-terms-of-gigatonnes-How-does-this-relate-to-tonnes-of-carbon-dioxide">Source</a>) 
		there is a total of almost a 100x as much, or ~3,500 Gigatons of CO2 in the atmosphere. Of this ~1,100 gigatons 
		of CO2 have been added due to human activity since 1880. Note that in a CO2 molecule, about 27% is carbon, so the 3,500 
		gigatons of CO2 in the atmosphere, means ~950 gigatons of carbon, of which ~300 Gigatons has been added since 1880. 
		And every year, this nunber goes up by another ~35-40 Gigatons or roughly ~10 Gigatons of Carbon!  There are about 3 
		trillion trees in the world (<a href="https://www.gotreequotes.com/how-many-trees-in-world/">Source: gotreequotes.com</a>), 
		and because of deforestation in the Amazon rainforests, Indonesia, and many other parts of the world 
		(<a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/11-of-the-world-s-most-threatened-forests">Source: WWF</a>), 
		this number is decreasing (for example, 90% of forests in Tanzania and Kenya, and two-thirds of the forests in Borneo, 
		have already been lost). There are many initiatives to plant more trees around the world (<a href="https://www.1t.org/">1t.org</a> 
		and <a href="https://onetrilliontrees.org/">onetrilliontrees.org</a>). So in order to understand the scale of planting 
		trees to combat climate change, we need to know: How far can trees go in reducing the excess carbon in our atmosphere? 
		Is this feasible? And what would it take?

	                </p>

                        <p>
                        One question people often ask is, since the trees are on the ground, and the CO2 is in the atmosphere, miles 
		above the trees, does it even make sense to use trees for carbon extraction? Since the air constantly keeps moving, 
		do the air molecules come down and make it to trees? To answer this question, I did an experiment to see how air molecules 
		travel within a closed room. It turns out air molecules are constantly moving around, at 300-400 meters per second 
		(<a href="https://www.education.vic.gov.au/school/teachers/teachingresources/discipline/science/continuum/Pages/particles.aspx">Source: Department of Education, Australia</a>), 
		or 675 to 900 mph! I tested this by checking how long it takes perfume to travel from one corner of a room to another. 
		I tried this by having my helper release perfume at the top of one corner of a 25 foot by 15 foot room. I stood on the 
		other end of the room (about 232 inches away) and could correctly recognize the smell of the perfume 70 seconds later. 
		So the air moved at ~3.3 inches per second.  In a different room, it traveled 170 inches in 52 seconds, again almost 
		the same 3.3 inches per second. While this seems slow (and keep in mind that this is without the influence of wind, jet 
		streams, etc.), most atmospheric CO2 resides in the lower stratosphere, which is ~9.3 miles above sea level. This means 
		that it would take ~2 days for a molecule of CO2 to travel from the lower stratosphere to the leaves of a tree. This is 
		assuming that there is no movement in the air that ever influences its movement to the surface, so 2 days is pretty good 
		by that standard.

                        </p>

                <p>
                Next, to understand how much carbon a tree can absorb, I measured the 
		increase in the carbon content in two trees in my backyard over ~12 weeks. These 
		are a type of cherry tree called drooping/weeping cherry. Their average current 
		weight is ~25 lbs. I measured the weight by the thickness of the trunk (about 1.5 
		inches) and their height (about 8 feet), and then adding a small percentage of weight 
		from the leaves, and using the average density of a cherry tree (750 kg / m^3) to 
		calculate the weight. 25lbs seems about right for my trees. As the trees get older, a 
		lot more carbon will come into the branches and of course the trunk will keep getting 
		bigger. I took three measurements, every 4 weeks, and the volume of the trees grew by 
		about 10% over the 12 weeks. My estimate is these trees added about 5 lbs of weight, of 
		which about 2.5lbs was the weight of carbon, because a tree is about 50% carbon
		(<a href="https://www.unm.edu/~jbrink/365/Documents/Calculating_tree_carbon.pdf">Source</a>). 
		So over 12 weeks, they absorbed roughly 2.5lbs of carbon from the air, and over a year 
		they will absorb roughly 10 lbs of carbon from the air. 
                </p>
						
		<p id="fourthparagraph">
		According to usda.gov, a mature tree absorbs 48 pounds 
	of carbon dioxide per year. This equates to ~13 pounds of carbon 
	per year. I can see how in 10 years my trees will be absorbing that 
	much carbon too. That carbon extraction rate means that in order to 
	absorb the extra 10 billion tons of carbon that we emit into the atmosphere 
	annually, we need to plant around <b>1.6 trillion trees</b>! 
	This excludes the remaining 300+ gigatons of excess carbon in the 
	atmosphere that we’ve been emitting into the atmosphere since the 
	1800s, and to actually get rid of this, we would have to plant several 
	times more.  There is a great initiative underway called 1 trillion trees 
	that aims to plant 1 trillion trees by 2030 (<a href="https://onetrilliontrees.org/">Source: onetrilliontrees.org</a>). 
	Assuming all deforestation stopped happening right now, urban sprawl 
	and land use for agriculture stopped increasing, and that the amount 
	of carbon emitted per year stopped increasing, this would require a minimum 
	of 15 million square kilometers, and 10 years from the time of planting 
	for the trees to start absorbing 48 pounds of carbon dioxide per year, 
	which, again, translates to ~13 pounds of carbon per year. Once they are 
	all at that maturity, they will be able to take out a (relatively) lackluster 
	~6.5 gigatons of Carbon out of the air every year. So, while these initiatives 
	to plant this many trees are really needed, they are not enough, especially when you 
	consider that as our population and our energy usage, grows, the amount 
	of carbon we emit into the atmosphere each year will increase and the 
	impact that these 1 trillion trees have will become less significant. 


	</p>

		<p id="fifthparagraph">
		Anyway, planting even 1 trillion trees (let alone 1.6) 
	is really, really hard. First, it would take years for those 
	trees to mature, and those trees wouldn’t start absorbing carbon 
	at the previously mentioned rate of 13 pounds of carbon per year 
	until the 2030s (assuming we instantly planted those 1.6 trillion 
	mature trees today). And, it will be hard to find enough space 
	where these trees can be planted.  So I looked up some data to
	understand the feasibility of planting a trillion trees.

		</p>

		<p id="sixthparagraph">
		According to ourworldindata.org (<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/land-use">Source</a>), 
	~29% of the Earth’s surface (or ~149 million square kilometers) consists of land, and the rest is 
	all ocean. Approximately 71% of this land is habitable (as in, trees can be planted there). 
	The rest is either made up of glaciers or barren land (deserts, salt flats, etc). Of the habitable 
	land, ~1% is used for urban and built-up areas, another ~1% consists of freshwater (rivers, lakes), 
	~11% consists of shrubland, ~37% consists of forests, and a gargantuan ~50% of all habitable land 
	goes to agriculture. This is roughly 51 million square kilometers of land used for agriculture! 
	Of that, ~77% (that is ~40 million square kilometers) is used for livestock (raising cows and other 
	animals for food), while the remaining ~23% is used for crops. Despite this, meat and dairy products 
	only provide ~18% of the global calorie supply, and ~37% of the global protein supply. Everything 
	else comes from plants.

	<!-- Clarify language around cities and shrubland usage -->

		A general guideline for planting medium-sized trees is to plant them 25-40 feet apart 
	(<a href="https://www.arborday.org/trees/righttreeandplace/size.cfm">Source: Arbor Day Foundation</a>). 
	Even if we were to plant our 1.6 trillion trees just 7 feet apart, each mature tree would need 
	150 square feet of space. So, to plant 1.6 trillion trees, we would need ~22 million square kilometeres of space,
	a space about as large as the entire north America, including the US, Canada, Mexico and more. Slowing urban sprawl 
	doesn't help us get more land to plant trees, and replacing shrubland with forest is pointless since shrubs also
	extract carbon from the atmosphere. This means that the only two sources of additional land for forests are 51 million square 
	kilometers of agriculture and 28 million square kilometers of habitable barren land. Transforming barren 
	land is rather simple in principle, because usually simply planting trees in barren areas will make the 
	areas not barren (provided they get enough care, fertilizers, water, etc). If we could lower our meat 
	consumption through lifestyle changes and also by adopting new types of food, we can also remove the immense amount 
	of land used for livestock production and replace it with forested land.

		How would we plant this many trees? If every human on the planet took it upon 
	themselves to plant trees, a trillion trees would mean each one of us needs to plant 
	~140 trees. 1.6 trillion trees means each of us needs to plant ~210 trees. If we did a 
	tree per month, this will take more than 17 years. Perhaps in more developed countries 
	we can do more, and we definitely should. Clearly this will be a mammoth task that will 
	have to be institutionalized somehow, and (multiple) organizations will need to be incentivized 
	to plant and maintain trees.  Every country should sign on to a certain number 
	of trees, and they should all agree on incentives for people to do so, on providing seeds, 
	best practices, etc. In India, the place where my parents grew up, the “Green Revolution” 
	was achieved basically within 20 years. Do we have the collective will to get something similar 
	done to save our planet?

	While I think that planting trees is a good idea, and beyond the climate benefits, trees 
	improve the aesthetics and biodiversity around us, I think that when it comes to the central question we are 
	contemplating here, trees alone will not get us there. We need new, technological 
	solutions to extract carbon from the air (for example, 
	<a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/the-dream-of-co2-air-capture-edges-toward-reality">DAC facilities</a>) 
	that are more efficient, cheaper and faster than planting trees. I look forward to 
	sharing more thoughts on that in my next blog.

		So the conclusion here is: Yes, we need to plant more trees, a lot of trees. 
	We need roughly 2 trillion more trees to make a real dent, so let’s start now. 
	And beyond planting trees, we need to do more, a lot more. We have one Earth, 
	and one fleeting chance to rescue it. Very soon it may be too late. So let’s do it, now. 
	Leaders of the world, this 14 year old joins millions of others to request you to 
	please come up with concrete goals and timelines, and execute. Talk alone gets nothing done, the action that comes from it 
	does. And there is already too much hot air around us.
