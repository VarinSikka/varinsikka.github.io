                        <p>
                        I read a paper recently that <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.04675.pdf">evaluated the performance</a> of various LLMs in translating various languages. The results seem 
                        pretty interesting (overall), and then this got me into a rabbit hole of trying to understand exactly how LLms do machine translation.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        Basically, inputs (the text you want to translate) are first "encoded" into tokens. Tokens are basically the smallest divisible parts of speech possible (if you're a 
                        linguistics nerd, these are basically just morphemes). Words are generally one token, such as "eat", "drink", "person", "tree", "food", but can also be more than one (like in 
                        "eat-ing", "tree-s", "push-ed", "anti-dis-establish-ment-arian-ism" with tokens separated by hyphens).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        After the text is encoded into these tokens, it's then decoded into the corresponding text of the target language. This is usually more complicated than it sounds; first 
                        you have to find the corresponding word for each token, then sometimes you have to "glue" the new tokens together to form words as needed, and then you have to rearrange the 
                        new words as appropriate for the new language.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        While the approach sounds pretty elegant, it makes a pretty critical assumption that makes it useless for languages that don't conform to this assumption: it assumes that 
                        all languages use the exact same set of morphemes. It's a fairly easy assumption to make, so we'll go into some languages that dont conform to it now.

                        <p>
                        Starting with two simple examples: Russian and Vietnamese. You've probably seen a lot of talk on how perceptions of color can vary languages, and both of these languages are 
                        examples of this. In English, basic words for colors can include red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, black, white, brown, pink, etc. Vietnamese, however, doesn't 
                        distinguish between "blue" and "green"; they're both considered "xanh". This isn't a problem if you're translating from English to Vietnamese, since whether you're describing 
                        something as "blue" or "green", you can translate it to "xanh" either way. This is a problem vice versa, however. Let's say you're translating "bàn đó xanh" ("that table is 
                        blue/green", also if this translation is wrong it was Google Translate's fault i swear) into English, and the table in question is actually blue. On its own, an LLM has no way 
                        of knowing that the table is green; it can't just look at the table itself and know what color it is. This makes accurately translating this simple, merely 3-word phrase entirely 
                        impossible without connecting it to some computer vision system that can identify the "table" mentioned and see what color it is. <br> Russian is a similar situation, it has a 
                        word for lighter shades of blue ("goluboy") and another for darker ones ("siniy"). If you're translating "that pen is blue" into Russian, the LLM translating it doesn't know 
                        if your pen is a lighter shade of blue or a darker one, and now we're in the same situation as Vietnamese.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        Now to Arizona for a more extreme example: Navajo. Navajo is (generally speaking) an agglutinative language, which basically means it really likes to "glue" together those 
                        tokens/morphemes mentioned earlier into words rather than leave them separate as in English. Navajo also has a B-52 Stratofortress's max cargo capacity worth of grammatical 
                        constructs that are not marked at all in English; such as the independent "durative", "conclusive", "semelfactive", "distributive", "reversative", and "cursive" (+more) verb aspects, none 
                        of which (to my knowledge) have any way of being marked with their own tokens in English. In addition, Navajo verb tokens get different forms depending on the shape of the object 
                        being interacted with; so "give" in "I give them hay" would be "níłjool", but "give" in "I give them a cigarette" would be "nítįįh". On top of all that, when tokens are glued together 
                        in the language, they may surface in a slightly different form that makes the presence of that token less clear; for example, "di'nisbąąs" can be tokenized into "di-'a-ni-sh-ł-bąąs".
                        First off, all of this makes acquiring certain tokens that have to be used in Navajo from an English text really hard, since English has no real equivalent of such grammatical 
                        features, and even if it does it probably doesn't need to be used like it does in Navajo; for example, the verb in "I am giving them water" could have the momentaneous, continuative, durative, 
                        semelfactive, conative, or cursive aspects, and since none of these aspect distinctions are made in English, without further context the LLM can't accurately determine which one to use; 
                        the same applies for knowing the shape of an object in questions. And second, in the language
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        There are probably a lot more examples of issues like this that occur for translating languages around the world using LLMs and tokenization; one of the biggest ones revolves around color perception, 
                        like in the first example mentioned, but some languages have no numbers, some languages have no relative directions (left/right, up/down, (for/back)ward), some languages have a distinction between third-
                        person obviative and third-person animate subjects (in other words, people in the third-person who are further away from a conversation get different pronouns than people who are closer to it), and more. 
                        Basically, given just how context-based languages can be, without some way to provide LLM machine translators with context of a phrase before translating the phrase, this isn't going to be feasible anytime 
                        soon for a <em>lot</em> of languages.
