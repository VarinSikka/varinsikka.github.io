                        It's been over one-and-a-half year since I last posted, and I'm currently on a vacation in a place I haven't been to for the same amount of time. 
                        When I was last here, I was writing up the first of my blogs on carbon capture with trees and climate change, and I suddenly remembered again that this 
                        blog was a thing. I've since made it to 11th grade, and I've done a lot of random research on various topics, mostly carbon capture and linguistics. 
                        I've done plenty of work on carbon capture since then which hopefully you'll hear more about it soon, but in the meantime I'll hopefully start 
                        publishing more frequently on this blog on random things I've researched, thoughts I have, etc. I'll try to diversify the topics of the blog 
                        too from this point on to try to talk about more interests of mine, like music (listening and composing), climate change, linguistics, other topics. 
                        Without further ado, one question I've often debated with some fellow linguistics enthusiasts, and also seen talked about online, is what the 
                        hardest script to read/write, or the hardest language to speak/learn is. Many people have their own different opinions on these questions, but my 
                        personal "hardest script to read" and "hardest language to speak" would be Khmer, the official language of Cambodia.
                        </p>

                    </div> <!-- entry__content -->

			<p>
			I'll first just clarify how I interpret these questions before I get into Khmer itself. To me, a script that is easy to read and write is one that is 
			<i>phonemic</i>; that means that each letter/symbol (technically a "grapheme") corresponds to an individual sound (technically a phoneme). 
			For example, the writing system for Spanish is mostly phonemic, so there is generally a one-to-one correspondence between graphemes and phonemes. 
			When there are exceptions to this pattern, there's usually even a pattern to those exceptions; for example, the letter "c" is pronounced as "s" 
			before "e/i", and as a "k" otherwise. Before "e/i", the "k" sound is spelled "qu" and before other vowels the "s" sound is spelled as "s". Now, 
			going by what I said about phonemic writing systems being "easy" to read for me, it follows that writing systems that are less phonemic are 
			harder to read.
			</p>

			<p>
			As for the second question, I'm a native English speaker from California, and I'm also fluent in Spanish and Hindi. I'm also currently learning 
			German. So, what I view as "hard to speak" would pretty much be anything that I wouldn't be familiar with from these languages. Of course, some 
			aspects of Khmer, such as its complex vowels or consonants clusters, may not seem so bad to a speaker of a related language, such as Vietnamese.
			</p>

			<p>
			With that said, let's first get into the difficult to speak aspects of the language, starting with the vowels. For fellow linguistics nerds or 
			vocalists, I'll also be using some IPA here and there in square brackets to transcribe the language. Khmer has 31 distinct vowel phonemes 
			(both monophthongs and diphthongs; that is, sequences of one vowel and two vowels). And that doesn't include cases where a "y" [j] or [w] 
			sound can occur after one of these 31 phonemes; if each of those cases is viewed as its own phoneme, that makes the total number 93! Even 
			when thinking of it as just 31, some of these phonemes have very subtle differences that many people wouldn't notice (and absolutely not 
			an English speaker). For example, [ae] is a different diphthong from [ai] (technically a sequence of [a] and following "y"), and while 
			these might obviously look different on paper, try saying them out loud quickly one after the other, and you grimly realize just how similar 
			they might sound. Also, vowels can be "long" or "short", and in the case of monophthongs, some phonemes are actually distinguished only by 
			length. And by the way, when I say length I don't mean in the sense English speakers are taught - like short "a" is in "cat" vs. long "a" as 
			in "ate" - I mean the actual duration for which the vowel is held and nothing else. (This isn't actually that unusual compared to other 
			world languages - Arabic, Sanskrit, Japanese, Thai, Classical Latin, and Finnish have it - but it's nonetheless confusing for English speakers).
			</p>

			<p>
			The other pronunciation quirk of Khmer is in its consonants clusters. The consonants themselves aren't too unusual, however Khmer does distinguish 
			between "unaspirated" and "aspirated" consonants. That is, consonants may be released with or without a slight extra puff of air that differentiates 
			phonemes. This features is often really hard for English speakers to master, since English doesn't have that distinction. There are also two consonants 
			usually transcribed with the letters "b" and "d", but they aren't quite the same; in Khmer they're pronounced with a slight closure of an area in the 
			throat called the glottis that gives these consonants the special name of "implosives". Besides that, the consonants are fairly usual <br><br> The issue 
			is in the way consonants can be organized at the start of words; they often occur in clusters of two (rarely three) consonants. Clusters like this 
			rarely occur in languages other than those in the same language family as Khmer, called the "Austroasiatic" language family. (TODO)
