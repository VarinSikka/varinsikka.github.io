                        How do we remove excess carbon from the atmosphere? This question is at the heart of the
climate change crisis we face. As the leaders of the world gather for COP26 in Glasgow, they
will debate and discuss a lot of different aspects because climate change covers a lot of stuff:
lowering GHG emissions from factories, landfills, cars, planes, our homes and offices, reducing
our meat consumption, going to plant based foods, from dealing with cows belching methane to
removing plastic from the oceans, from lowering our oil addiction to producing better energy,
and storing it and many others. All of this is great, and if we can mobilize action on all these
fronts, super. But from what I see, progress on these fronts will at best be slow. If we want to
make substantial progress, I believe the main question to address is: how do we remove excess
carbon from our atmosphere? In this series of blogs I want to address this question, from my
point of view as a 14 year old.

			There is a lot of talk, and also action, around using trees to remove carbon. Last year, in my final
year of middle school, I did some experiments to understand the size and scale of this, inspired
by Fermi Estimates (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_problem">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_problem</a>). Here goes:
			</p>
			
			<p>
			According to NASA, we emit ~10 gigatons of carbon into the atmosphere 
every year (we emit far more carbon every year, but ~10 gigatons is the 
amount of carbon that is added to the atmosphere and not absorbed by 
trees, the ocean, or anything else). According to three experts on Quora
 (an unnamed research engineer, Frank Roeske and Riggald Eux), there is a
 total of ~3,200 gigatons of CO2 in the atmosphere, and of this ~1,100 
gigatons of CO2 have been added due to human activity since 1880. There 
are about 3 trillion trees in the world (<a href="https://www.gotreequotes.com/how-many-trees-in-world/#:~:text=Globally%2C%20there%20are%20estimated%20to%20be%203.04%20trillion%20trees.&amp;text=This%20means%20that%20there%20are,for%20every%20person%20on%20earth.">Source: gotreequotes.com</a>), and because of deforestation in the Amazon rainforests, Indonesia, and many other parts of the world (<a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/11-of-the-world-s-most-threatened-forests">Source: WWF</a>),
 this number is decreasing. People are also thinking about, and 
launching, initiatives to plant more trees around the world. So the 
questions I want to explore are: What can we do using trees to reduce 
the excess carbon in our atmosphere? Is this feasible? And what would it
 take?
	                </p>

                        <p>
                        One question people often ask is, since the trees are on the ground, 
and the CO2 is in the atmosphere, sometimes miles above the trees, does 
it even make sense to use trees for carbon extraction? Since the air 
constantly keeps moving, do the air molecules come down and bounce off 
trees? To answer this question, <b>my first experiment</b> was to see 
how air molecules travel within a closed room. It turns out air 
molecules are constantly moving around, at 300-400 meters per second (<a href="https://www.education.vic.gov.au/school/teachers/teachingresources/discipline/science/continuum/Pages/particles.aspx#:~:text=The%20oxygen%20and%20nitrogen%20molecules,no%20loss%20of%20kinetic%20energy.">Source: Department of Education, Australia</a>),
 or 675 to 900 mph! I tested this by checking how long it takes perfume 
to travel from one corner of a room to another. I tried this by having 
my helper release perfume at the top of one corner of a 25 foot by 15 
foot room. I stood on the other end of the room (about 232 inches away) 
and could correctly recognize the smell of the perfume 70 seconds later.
 So the air moved at ~3.3 inches per second (There was some human error 
here because initially I couldn’t recognize the smell, but I did this 
experiment again with me knowing the smell of the perfume and got a 
similar rate -- 170 inches in about 52 seconds). While this seems slow 
(and keep in mind that this is without the influence of wind, jet 
streams, etc), most atmospheric CO2 resides in the lower stratosphere, 
which is ~9.3 miles above sea level. This means that it would take ~2 
days for a molecule of CO2 to travel from the lower stratosphere to the 
leaves of a tree. Okay, so trees could do the job. Even if there were no
 hurricanes and jet streams etc., air would move around the world and 
make its way down to trees.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        Next, to understand how much carbon a tree can absorb, I measured the 
increase in the carbon content in two trees in my backyard over ~12 
weeks. These are a type of cherry tree called drooping/weeping cherry. 
Their average current weight is ~25 lbs. I measured the weight by the 
thickness of the trunk (about 1.5 inches) and their height (about 8 
feet), and then adding a small percentage of weight from the leaves, and
 using the average density of a cherry tree (750 kg / m^3) to calculate 
the weight. 25lbs seems about right for my trees. As the trees get 
older, a lot more carbon will come into the branches and of course the 
trunk will keep getting bigger. I took three measurements, every 4 
weeks, and the volume of the trees grew by about 10% over the 12 weeks. 
My estimate is these trees added about 3.5 lbs of weight, of which about 
2lbs was the weight of carbon. So over 12 weeks, they absorbed roughly
 2lbs of carbon from the air, and over a year they will take out 
roughly 10 lbs of carbon from the air.
                        </p>
						
		<p id="fourthparagraph">
		According to usda.gov, a mature tree absorbs 48 pounds of carbon per 
zyear. I can see how in 10 years my trees will be absorbing that much 
carbon too. That carbon extraction rate means that in order to absorb 
the extra <span class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-var="carbonintake" data-min="1" data-max="20" data-step="1" style="pointer-events: auto;"><div class="TKAdjustableNumberHelp" style="display: none;">drag</div> billion tons of carbon</span> that we emit into the atmosphere annually, we need to plant around <b data-var="treeamount"><span>416</span> billion trees</b>!
 This excludes the remaining 300+ gigatons of excess carbon in the 
atmosphere that we’ve been emitting into the atmosphere since the 1800s,
 and to actually get rid of this, we would have to plant billions more 
trees.

	</p>

	<p id="fifthparagraph">
		Planting this many trees is extremely hard. First, it would take years
 for those trees to mature, and those trees wouldn’t start absorbing 
carbon at the aforementioned rate of 48 pounds per year until the 2030s 
(assuming we instantly planted 416 billion mature trees today). Second, 
we don’t have enough space for those trees.
	</p>

	<p id="sixthparagraph">
		According to ourworldindata.org, ~29% of the Earth’s surface (or ~149 
million square kilometers) consists of land, and the rest is all ocean. 
Approximately 71% of this land is habitable (as in, trees can be planted
 there). The rest is either made up of glaciers or barren land (deserts,
 salt flats, etc). Of the habitable land, ~1% is used for urban and 
built-up areas, another ~1% consists of freshwater (rivers, lakes), ~11%
 consists of shrubland, ~37% consists of forests, and a gargantuan ~50% 
of all habitable land goes to agriculture. This is roughly 51 million 
square kilometers of land used for agriculture! Of that, ~77% (that’s 
~40 million square kilometers) is used for livestock (raising cows and 
other animals for food), while the remaining ~23% is used for crops. 
Despite this, meat and dairy products only provide ~18% of the global 
calorie supply, and ~37% of the global protein supply. Everything else 
comes from plants.
	</p>

	<!-- Clarify language around cities and shrubland usage -->
	<p id="seventhparagraph">
		A general guideline for planting medium-sized trees is to plant them 25-40 feet apart (<a href="https://www.arborday.org/trees/righttreeandplace/size.cfm">Source: Arbor Day Foundation</a>). Even if we were to plant our 416 billion trees just 7 feet apart, each mature tree would need <span class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-var="squarefeetpertree" data-min="100" data-max="1000" data-step="10" style="pointer-events: auto;"><span></span><div class="TKAdjustableNumberHelp" style="display: none;">drag</div> square feet</span> of space. So, to plant <span class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-var="trees" data-min="797" data-max="2007" data-step="10" style="pointer-events: auto;"><span></span><div class="TKAdjustableNumberHelp" style="display: none;">drag</div> billion trees</span>, we would need around <b data-var="kilometers"><span>22</span> million square kilometers</b>
 of space. Slowing urban sprawl to prevent them from using land won't 
help us get more land to plant trees considering how little land they 
use, and replacing shrubland with forest is pointless since shrubs also 
extract carbon from the atmosphere. This means that the only two sources
 of additional land for forests are 51 million square kilometers of 
agriculture and 28 million square kilometers of habitable barren land. 
Transforming barren land is rather simple in principle, because usually 
simply planting trees in barren areas will make the areas not barren 
(provided they get enough care, fertilizers, water, etc). If we could 
lower our meat consumption through lifestyle changes and also by 
adopting new types of food (like Impossible burgers), we can also remove
 the immense amount of land used for livestock production and replace it
 with forested land.
	</p>

	<p id="eighthparagraph">
		There is an initiative underway called 1 trillion trees that aims to 
		plant 1 trillion trees by 2030 (<a href="https://onetrilliontrees.org/">Source: onetrilliontrees.org</a>). Assuming 
no further deforestation, no further increase in land for livestock, and
 (this is the big one) that there is no additional human-produced carbon
 coming into the atmosphere, this would require a minimum of 15 million 
square kilometers, and 10 years from the time of planting for the trees 
to start absorbing 48 pounds of carbon per year. Once they are all at 
that maturity, they will be able to take out an impressive 22 gigatons 
of Carbon out of the air every year, but by then we will have a lot more
 CO2, and carbon, to be removed, than we have today. Realistically, 
probably another 100 gigatons by then.
	</p>

	<p id="ninthparagraph">
		How would we plant this many trees? If every human on the planet took 
it upon themselves to plant trees, 460 billion trees would mean each one
 of us needs to plant ~65 trees. If we did a tree per month, this is 
more than 5 years. And a trillion trees is more than twice this. Perhaps
 in the western countries we can, and should, do more. Clearly this will
 be a mammoth task that will have to be institutionalized somehow, and 
organizations will need to be incentivized to plant and maintain trees.
	</p>

	<p id="tenthparagraph">
		Altogether, this seems like a tall order. While I believe that 
planting trees is a good idea, and beyond the climate benefits, trees 
improve the aesthetics and biodiversity around us, I think that trees 
alone will not get us there. We need new, technological solutions to 
extract carbon from the air that are more efficient, cheaper and faster 
than planting trees.
