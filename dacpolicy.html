                        <h3>Background</h3>

                        <p>
                        Climate change is clearly a pressing problem for humanity today. Indeed, according to <a href="https://climateclock.world/">climateclock.world</a>, as of 
                        July 2023, we have six years to limit global warming to the “event horizon” number of less than 1.5 ºC. The main 
                        contributor to global warming is anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions — that is, human-caused emissions of gasses 
                        (e.g. carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide) that trap heat in the atmosphere called greenhouse gasses (GHGs). 
                        Global GHG emissions come from many different industrial uses, in many different industrial sectors, as illustrated 
                        in <a href="https://www.wri.org/data/world-greenhouse-gas-emissions-2016">this graph</a> from the WRI. In order for 
                        humanity to live sustainably and avert the suffering global warming will 
                        soon cause, we must act quickly to lower our greenhouse gas emissions, but as the graph above shows, these emissions 
                        come from many different industrial end uses and sectors. So, although it is incredibly necessary to reduce our GHG 
                        emissions fast, to do so we need the extensive cooperation of many industries and people, the development and implementation 
                        of relatively new technologies (such as renewable energy sources), and support from governments around the world.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        Therefore, we can safely say that reducing our greenhouse gas emissions in even ten years, let alone six, may not be 
                        possible without immediate and rapid mobilization and cooperation around the world. This mobilization and cooperation 
                        currently does not exist. However, one technology that has become quite promising in recent years is <b>carbon dioxide removal</b> 
                        (CDR), which focuses on removing from the atmosphere the most prominent GHG we emit: carbon dioxide (CO2). If used in 
                        addition to the implementation of more sustainable industrial processes, CDR may make humanity’s path towards sustainability 
                        more feasible. However, CDR, as with any developing technology, will benefit from support and oversight from world governments.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        Hence, the goal of this paper is to outline the current state of CDR technologies, as well as technologies to store and utilize 
                        CO2, and to provide recommendations for how governments can support and incentivize the development and implementation of CDR 
                        initiatives.

                        <h3>CDR Overview</h3>

                        <p>
                        There are five general methods of CDR, although within each method there may be significant variation in materials and processes used. These are:

                                </ol>

                        <p>
                        CCS generally refers to the process of capturing carbon dioxide directly from streams of gasses emitted by industrial processes. CO<sub>2</sub> is far more 
                        concentrated in these streams called “flue gas streams” (Global CCS Institute, <a href="https://www.globalccsinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Technology-Readiness-and-Costs-for-CCS-2021-1.pdf">see Table 4</a>) compared to the average atmospheric concentration of 
                        CO<sub>2</sub>, which is currently ~418 parts per million (NOAA, <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-atmospheric-carbon-dioxide">climate.gov</a>). CCS is sometimes used interchangeably with the term CDR, although they do not 
                        have the same meaning; the latter generally refers to the process of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere regardless of specific method.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        As the list above shows, CCS breaks down into three general types: post-combustion, pre-combustion, and oxyfuel combustion CCS. The first method, 
                        <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/18/carbon-capture-storage-technologies">post-combustion CCS</a>, is the most widely used and developed, having first been patented <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US1783901A/en">in 1930</a>. In the past, it has been used for other gasses such 
                        as carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide (the latter of which was the main component of acid rain) as a process generally called <a href="https://www.generon.com/amine-gas-sweetening-process/">“gas sweetening”</a>, 
                        and recently for CO<sub>2</sub>. In this method, flue gas streams pass through an “absorber column” containing a liquid that gets saturated with the target. 
                        Once the liquid is fully saturated, superheated steam is passed through the absorber column, which releases the CO<sub>2</sub> for transport elsewhere.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/18/carbon-capture-storage-technologies">Pre-combustion CCS</a> is generally used with a type of power plant called an integrated coal gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power plant. In 
                        IGCC power plants, coal is turned into “syngas” which consists mainly of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. These react with water to form CO<sub>2</sub> and 
                        more hydrogen gas. The hydrogen gas is used for energy production, and the CO<sub>2</sub> is sequestered then transported or stored.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        Oxyfuel combustion typically refers to a process used in the steel industry and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/oxyfuel">welding</a>, however this process can easily be combined with CCS. 
                        In this method, oxygen is separated out of other atmospheric gasses; in welding and the steel industry, this highly concentrated oxygen is useful 
                        because it creates a very hot flame. Since it is the oxygen in air that reacts to form CO<sub>2</sub> and water vapor when combusted, the resulting flue gas 
                        will only contain CO<sub>2</sub> and water vapor. The proportions of the amounts of the two gasses in the resulting mixture depends on the hydrocarbon used for 
                        combustion. (In the oxyfuel process used for welding mentioned in the link above, acetylene (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>) is combusted with oxygen. This particular reaction 
                        is 2(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>)+5(O<sub>2</sub>) -> 2(H<sub>2</sub>O)+4(CO<sub>2</sub>) , thus ⅔ of this reaction’s products are CO<sub>2</sub>). Since most of this gas is CO<sub>2</sub> (and water vapor is itself a mild greenhouse gas), 
                        the whole mixture can be sequestered.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        The two other methods do not necessarily capture CO2 directly from industrial contexts. Bioenergy Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) is a method that 
                        utilizes organic material (i.e. biomass) in industrial processes (e.g. ethanol production) and captures the carbon produced from it (typically using 
                        the same technologies as those used to trap the CO2 in CCS). This actually leads to a net-CO2 removal from the atmosphere, since the CO2 in the biomass 
                        was captured by natural processes. Direct Air Capture (DAC) is somewhat functionally similar to CCS in that air is typically channeled through some kind 
                        of material that separates the CO2 from everything else. However, DAC differs in the key aspect that it captures ambient air directly from the atmosphere 
                        rather than from industrial processes.
